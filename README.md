# OOP-Python
```OOP is one of the basic concepts and even though Python does not support all kinds of OOP operations, we somehow manage to sort all kinds of operations.```

<h5>However, the basics of Python is a must to understand OOP concepts, so it's better to learn the basic python first.</h5>

In python, we can not use same method with different parameters, the latest one is always countable which most of the time raises an error, same goes for constructors.
For this reason, we do method and constructor overloading and use (```*args, **kwargs```) if we do not know out argument input size.
